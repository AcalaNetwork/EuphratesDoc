# Do I have an Unified Account

### I have a Substrate account/Ethereum account, how do I know if it has been setup as Unified Account?

At the Polkadot.js UI you can easily query Unified Account with a Substrate or Ethereum account, just step by step below, follow this link to skip steps 1-3 and start from step 4.

1. Browse https://polkadot.js.org,
2. Select Acala network,&#x20;
3. Go to Developer tab on top menu and select Chain State
4. Select "EVM accounts" and "accounts(H160): Option\<AccountId32>"

When you try to bind a Substrate account to an Ethereum account, if it complains that it's already bound, then you can&#x20;

* use the above method to find out which Ethereum account it is
* log in with that Ethereum account instead OR
* use a different Substrate account to bind
