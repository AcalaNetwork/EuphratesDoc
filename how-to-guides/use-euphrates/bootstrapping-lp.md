**What happens if the Liquidity Target isn't reached?**&#x20;

Tokens will be returned to the users split evenly between the two assets. \

Assets are locked for the duration of the Boostrapping Period. Assets can be withdraw after the pool is successfully launched or will be returned if the pool is unsuccessful

**Do I have to deposit an equal amount of both assets?**

No. You can deposit any amount of the assets and the asset will convert the assets evenly into the LP.

**Can I deposit only one asset into the LP?**

Yes. You can deposit either side of the LP's asset and in any amount. The asset router will convert the assets evenly into the LP.&#x20;
