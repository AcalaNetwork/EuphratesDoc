# Risks and Disclaimer Notice

We prioritize safety and security, but it's important to acknowledge the inherent risks associated with engaging with decentralized-finance smart contracts, pallets, and networks. We have taken extensive measures to ensure the reliability of Euphrates smart contracts, including thorough internal reviews, engaging external auditors to identify and address potential vulnerabilities prior to the platform's launch, and setting up bug bounties such as [Immunifi](https://immunefi.com/bug-bounty/euphrates/). However, it's essential to recognize that there is still a possibility, albeit low, of experiencing partial or complete loss of funds. Therefore, we strongly advise users to exercise caution and operate within their own risk framework when interacting with the platform.

**General Risks**

* **Smart Contract Risks:** Your staked assets will be managed through Acala smart contracts. While we ensure high-security standards, smart contracts inherently come with risks such as bugs and vulnerabilities.
* **Loss of Funds:** There is always a possibility of partial or complete loss of funds. Exercise caution and operate within your own risk framework.
* **User Responsibility:** It is crucial to understand the risks involved and conduct your own research before participating. Stay informed about any updates or changes to the smart contracts and tokens used.

**Euphrates Platform and Native Pools**

Despite extensive measures to ensure the reliability of our smart contracts, potential vulnerabilities may still exist. Users should be aware of and accept the risks associated with decentralized finance.

**Acala Native Pools (LDOT and LCDOT)**

* **Smart Contract Risks on Acala Network:** Your staked assets will be managed through smart contracts on the Acala network. While we ensure high-security standards, smart contracts inherently come with risks, such as bugs and vulnerabilities.
* **Rewards and Principal:** We strive to provide bonus rewards for staking your assets, but we cannot guarantee specific returns or the safety of the principal amount staked. Staking involves risks, so please only stake within your risk profile.

Read about our [Homa Protocol (LDOT) documentation](https://docs.homastaking.app/) and [Liquid Crowdloan (LCDOT) documentation](https://wiki.acala.network/crowdloans/acala-crowdloan/faq#liquid-crowdloan-and-lcdot).&#x20;

**External Pools**

Euphrates integrates with several external platforms, which come with their own sets of risks. It is important to thoroughly review the documentation and risk explanations provided by these platforms before engaging with them. Below are the details of the external pools:

* **TDOT (Taiga Liquid Staking Token):** Your assets are subject to the smart contract risks associated with Taiga Finance tDOT, including technological, governance, and security risks. For more information, please review [Taiga Finance's website.](https://www.taigaprotocol.io/)
* **JitoSOL (Liquid Staking Token):** Our staking pool uses JitoSOL liquid staking tokens. Consequently, your assets are subject to the smart contract risks associated with JitoSOL, including technological, governance, and security risks. For more information, please review [JitoSOL's risk documentation](https://www.jito.network/docs/jitosol/disclaimer/).
* **Stellaswap (Decentralized Exchange):** Our platform integrates with Stellaswap, a decentralized exchange (DEX). Engaging with Stellaswap involves risks such as smart contract vulnerabilities, liquidity risks, and market volatility. Your assets may be subject to these risks when using Stellaswap. For more information, please review [Stellaswap's security documentation](https://docs.stellaswap.com/resources/security).

**Final Note**

By engaging with the Euphrates platform and associated staking activities, you acknowledge and accept the risks outlined above. It is your responsibility to stay informed and make decisions that align with your risk tolerance. We recommend thoroughly reviewing all relevant documentation and conducting your own research to ensure you are fully aware of the potential risks involved.
