# Unstake

The unstaking process for a single-sided staking pool generally follows the same procedure. Below, we provide an example of unstaking from the LCDOT pool with steps that can be applied to any single-sided staking pool.

The difference lies in state the token is received in after unstaking:

* For **LCDOT staking**, you will receive **LDOT (on Acala)** after unstaking.
* For **DOT staking**, you will receive **LDOT (on Acala)** after unstaking.
* For **JitoSOL staking**, you will receive **JitoSOL (on AcalaEVM)** after unstaking.

**Pre-Requisite** Polkadot or Acala based tokens require a unified account for the full experience. AcalaEVM tokens do not need a unified account but is encoruage to create one to unlock all current and future possibilities. \
