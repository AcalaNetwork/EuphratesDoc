# Get LCDOT/ACA

To get LCDOT, or ACA (required for fee for staking in Euphrates), go to [AcalaSwap](https://apps.acala.network/swap) - instructions [here](https://guide.acalaapps.wiki/acala-swap/swapping-tokens).

If you have DOT, you can [follow this guide](https://guide.acalaapps.wiki/general/bringing-tokens-to-karura/dot-transfers) to transfer DOT onto Acala to swap LCDOT or pay fees or participate in DOT related pools etc.
