# Rewards

Euphrates rewards are made of incentive rewards in ACA and participating projects tokens and LST protocol yields:

* tDOT APR ([App](https://www.taigaprotocol.io/), [Protocol](https://docs.taigaprotocol.io/overview/introduction))
* LDOT APR ([App](https://apps.acala.network/ldot), [Protocol](https://docs.homastaking.app/))

## LCDOT Staking Rewards

There are two staking pools for LCDOT holders: LDOT and tDOT Pools

**Before unlock (aka before Acala lease ends)**

LDOT Pool APR = ACA incentive APR

tDOT Pool APR = ACA incentive APR + TAI incentive APR

**After unlock (aka Acala lease ends)**

LDOT Pool APR = ACA incentive APR + LDOT APR

tDOT Pool APR = ACA incentive APR + TAI incentive APR + tDOT APR

## DOT Staking Rewards

There are two staking pools for DOT holders: LDOT and tDOT Pools

LDOT Pool APR = ACA incentive APR + LDOT APR

tDOT Pool APR = ACA incentive APR + TAI incentive APR + tDOT APR

## Incentive Rewards

Each pool can set up an incentive program to

* run for a specific period of time
* with a certain amount of reward tokens to be distributed every x blocks
* stakers will receive rewards pro-rata to their share of the pool
* the incentive program can include ACA and other participating project tokens
* with loyalty bonus

### Loyalty Bonus

The purpose of Loyalty Bonus is to

* avoid hot bags mining and dumping
* encouraging more sustainable, longer term farming for the benefit of the protocol and the entire network
* share more rewards for longer term liquidity providers compared to just vesting

**How does Loyalty Bonus work?**

A Loyalty Bonus ratio e.g. 40% can be set up for each program

* a staker will need to keep the reward token in the pool until the end of the program to receive the bonus
* if the staker claims the reward tokens earlier, then its bonus will be added back to the reward pool to be shared amongst other stakers
* long term stakers are likely to receive higher rewards than standard rewards
