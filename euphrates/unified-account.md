# Unified Account

With the Unified Account system, users can use an Ethereum account to interact with contracts in EVM, Polkadot/Acala Substrate runtime, and a hybrid of these. Users can simply bind their Ethereum account with a Polkadot/Substrate account (serving as proof of ownership for both accounts), then the Ethereum account can be used to sign a Polkadot/Substrate transaction such as participating in native Polkadot liquid staking.

To enable Unified Account and use Acala EVM+, simply bind your Ethereum account with a Polkadot/Substrate account _**once**_, and you can then use the Ethereum account via popular wallets like MetaMask and Wallet Connect. You can find the step-by-step guide [here](../how-to-guides/setup-wallet/#step-by-step-guide).
