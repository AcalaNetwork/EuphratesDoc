Euphrates provides a stake-and-forget service with extra rewards for LCDOT holders:

* stake LCDOT into a LST (liquid staking token) pool of choice e.g. tDOT pool, LDOT pool
* stakers start earning rewards in ACA and participating project tokens immediately upon Acala crowdloan unlock ([at block 17856000, Oct 24\~](https://polkadot.subscan.io/block/17856000))
* staked LCDOT will automatically be claimed into DOT
* claimed DOT will automatically be turned into LST of choice
* do not miss a day of DOT staking rewards

Users can also withdraw LCDOT to DOT, if they choose not to participate in staking.
