# Risks

While we prioritize safety and security, it's important to acknowledge the inherent risks associated with engaging with decentralized-finance smart contracts, pallets and networks. We have taken extensive measures to ensure the reliability of Euphrates smart contracts, including thorough internal reviews and engaging external auditors to identify and address potential vulnerabilities prior to the platform's launch, and set up bug bounties such as [Immunifi](https://immunefi.com/bounty/euphrates/).

However, it's essential to recognize that there is still a possibility, albeit low, of experiencing partial or complete loss of funds. Therefore, we strongly advise users to exercise caution and operate within their own risk framework when interacting with the platform.

In addition to the specific risks associated with Euphrates, users should also consider the risks associated with [Acala Liquid Crowdloan DOT LCDOT](https://wiki.acala.network/crowdloans/acala-crowdloan/faq#liquid-crowdloan-and-lcdot), [Homa Liquid Staking DOT](https://docs.homastaking.app/) and [Taiga Finance tDOT](https://www.taigaprotocol.io/) as Euphrates integrates directly with them. It is important to thoroughly review the documentation and risk explanations provided by these platforms before engaging with them.
