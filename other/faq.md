### When can I convert my LCDOT back to DOT?

After the Acala crowdloan unlock ([at block 17856000, 00:08 UTC Oct 24\~](https://polkadot.subscan.io/block/17856000)).

### What is LCDOT?

LCDOT stands for Liquid Crowdloan DOT. It is a token that is a 1:1 representation of DOT locked in the Acala crowdloan. You can obtain LCDOT from [Acala Swap](https://apps.acala.network/swap).

### What is Euphrates?

Euphrates primarily allows stakers and liquidity providers of LSTs (liquid staking tokens) to earn boosted rewards and also claim ACA and other participating project token rewards. Euphrates will be deployed with DOT-based LST liquidity vaults, and later expanded to support Ethereum and other multichain LST liquidity vaults.

### How does Euphrates work?

For LCDOT stakers, DOT will automatically be claimed and turned into an LST of choice upon the Acala crowdloan unlock ensuring users donâ€™t miss a day of DOT staking rewards.

For DOT stakers, DOT will automatically be turned into an LST of choice.

LSTs can be withdrawn at any time and both paths reward ACA and participating project tokens

### Is it safe to use and work with Euphrates?

In order to be safe, Euphrates continues to do the following

* Open sourcing & continuous reviewing of all codes

### What are the risks of using Euphrates?

There are always \*\*\*\*inherent risks associated with engaging with decentralized-finance smart contracts, pallets and networks :

* Smart Contract & Pallet risks: Euphrates code is open-sourced, audited and covered by bug bounty
* Associated risks from protocols including [Acala Liquid Crowdloan DOT LCDOT](https://wiki.acala.network/crowdloans/acala-crowdloan/faq#liquid-crowdloan-and-lcdot), [Homa Liquid Staking DOT](https://docs.homastaking.app/) and [Taiga Finance tDOT](https://www.taigaprotocol.io/) as Euphrates integrates directly with them.

Acala is determined to mitigate the above risks and eliminate them entirely to the extent possible. Despite this, they may still exist.
